# Note Taker

## Description

This application is designed for keeping track of notes and saving them for future use. The app will let the user create a title of the note, as well as save any text related to that title.

This assignment builds off of the lessons we learned with Express, as well as using GET-fetch, POST-fetch, and Modular routing.
